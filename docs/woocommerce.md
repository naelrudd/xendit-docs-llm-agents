# WooCommerce

WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin that turns a WordPress site into a fully functional eCommerce platform. The plugin is hosted and managed entirely by merchants within their chosen environment.

To enhance the payment experience, our **Xendit-WooCommerce plugin** can be installed on your WooCommerce store to provide secure online payment capabilities. This plugin will allow you to accept a wide range of payment methods through Xendit with minimal configuration effort.

Follow this guideline to start integrating Xendit with your WooCommerce platform.

## Requirements

Before integrating Xendit with WooCommerce, ensure the following requirements are met:

1. **System Requirements**:
  - WordPress version: **4.8.3** or above.
  - WooCommerce version: **3.1.2** or above.
  - PHP version: **7.0** or above.
  - Ensure **cURL with OpenSSL** is enabled by your web hosting provider.
2. **Xendit Account Setup**:
  - Register for a Xendit account and retrieve your **test** and **live API keys**.
  - Remove any IP whitelist from your Xendit dashboard.
  - Have **Admin** or **Developer** access in the Xendit Dashboard.
  - You do **not** need to set up a callback URL in the Xendit dashboard; the WooCommerce plugin automatically handles this.
3. **Plugin Installation**:
  - Download and install the Xendit WooCommerce plugin [here](/docs/woocommerce#).

By completing these steps, you’ll be ready to integrate and start accepting payments with Xendit on your WooCommerce store.
