# Authorization and Capture Flow (Manual Capture)

In addition to one-time automatic payments, Payment Link also support an **authorization and capture** flow (manual capture). This allows you to:

- Authorize a customer’s payment method during checkout.
- Capture the funds later (e.g., after confirming stock, shipping, or service fulfillment).

This flow is commonly used by eCommerce, marketplaces, travel, and on-demand services.

## How it works

1. Create a Payment Session with `capture_method: MANUAL`
2. Redirect the end user to Xendit-hosted page
3. End user completes payment in Xendit-hosted page
4. Payment is **AUTHORIZED** (funds held, not yet captured)
5. You receive `payment_session.completed`
6. Capture the payment via Payment API when ready
7. Xendit sends `payment.capture` webhook

## How to integrate

1. When your customer is ready to proceed with a payment, your system should create a Payment Session with `capture_method: MANUAL` using the example payload below. This will authorize the payment first (placing a hold on the funds) and allow you to capture the payment at a later time.

**Request - POST /sessions**

```json
{
    "reference_id": "{{$YOUR_REFERENCE_ID}}",
    "session_type": "PAY",
    "mode": "PAYMENT_LINK",
    "capture_method": "MANUAL",
    "amount": 150000,
    "currency": "IDR",
    "country": "ID",
    "customer": {
        "reference_id": "{{$randomUUID}}",
        "type": "INDIVIDUAL",
        "email": "customer@yourdomain.com",
        "mobile_number": "+628123456789",
        "individual_detail": {
            "given_names": "John",
            "surname": "Doe"
        }
    },
    "success_return_url": "https://yourcompany.com/order/complete",
    "cancel_return_url": "https://yourcompany.com/order/cancel"
}
```

**Response - POST /sessions**

```json
{
    "payment_session_id": "ps-67527107dda8b2513acdaef0",
    "created": "2024-12-06T03:35:36.032Z",
    "updated": "2024-12-06T03:35:36.032Z",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "reference_id": "b767f88f-b5bc-4836-9c47-c14261909dec",
    "currency": "IDR",
    "amount": 150000,
    "country": "ID",
    "customer_id": "cust-fe8743c3-f554-4d25-a0e9-9980226c4b1b",
    "expires_at": "2024-12-06T04:05:35.049Z",
    "session_type": "PAY",
    "capture_method": "MANUAL",
    "mode": "PAYMENT_LINK",
    "locale": "en",
    "business_id": "62440e322008e87fb29c1fd0",
    "success_return_url": "https://yourcompany.com/order/complete",
    "cancel_return_url": "https://yourcompany.com/order/cancel",
    "payment_link_url": "https://dev.xen.to/qZx5RD_7"
}
```

1. Once the Payment Session is created, redirect your end user to the **Xendit-hosted checkout page** using the `payment_link_url` from the response.
2. Your customer will complete the authorization flow on the Xendit-hosted page
3. Upon successful authorization, Xendit will send a `payment_session.completed` webhook. The webhook contains the `payment_id` with status `AUTHORIZED`. You should store the `payment_id,`mark the order as **authorized,** and capture the payment once the order or service is confirmed.

## How to capture an authorized payment

To capture an authorized payment, use the [Payment API v3 capture endpoint](https://docs.xendit.co/apidocs/capture-payment) with the `payment_id` obtained from the authorization step.

Request - `POST /payments/{payment_id}/capture`

```json
{   
   "capture_amount": 10000 
}
```

If successful, you will received the `payment.capture` webhook the payment status will change to `CAPTURED`.

Uncaptured authorizations are valid for **7 days**. If the payment is not captured within this period, the authorization will automatically expire and the funds will be released to the customer.

If you intend to cancel the authorization before capturing it, you can call the [Cancel Payment endpoint](https://docs.xendit.co/apidocs/cancel-payment) using the same `payment_id`. This will void the authorization and release the held funds.
