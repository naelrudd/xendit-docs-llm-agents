### Optional: Firewall Whitelisting

If you happen to use firewall, there's an optional step, which is to whitelist Xendit Callback URL in order to avoid unreceived callback:

**Magento: <merchant_site>/xendit/checkout/notification**

You can input the URL when creating firewall rules. Example below is the display if you're using Cloudflare:
