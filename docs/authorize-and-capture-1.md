# Authorization and Capture Flow (Manual Capture)

> [!NOTE]
> Currently authorization and capture flow is only available for Cards payment.

In addition to one-time automatic payments, Xendit Components also support an **authorization and capture** flow (manual capture). This allows you to:

- Authorize a customer’s payment method during checkout.
- Capture the funds later (e.g., after confirming stock, shipping, or service fulfillment).

This flow is commonly used by eCommerce, marketplaces, travel, and on-demand services.

## How it works

1. Create a Payment Session with `capture_method: MANUAL` in your server
2. Mount Xendit Components in your client app with this [guideline](https://docs.xendit.co/docs/components-overview)
3. End user complete the payment on your hosted page
4. Payment is **AUTHORIZED** (funds held, not yet captured)
5. You receive `payment_session.completed`
6. Capture the payment via Payment API v3 when ready
7. Xendit sends `payment.capture` webhook

## How to integrate

Refer to the [Xendit Components integration guide](https://docs.xendit.co/docs/components-overview) for the implementation.

When your customer is ready to proceed with a payment, your system should create a Payment Session with `capture_method: MANUAL` using the example payload below. This will authorize the payment first (placing a hold on the funds) and allow you to capture the payment at a later time.

**Request -** `POST /sessions`

```json
{
    "reference_id": "{{$YOUR_REFERENCE_ID}}",
    "session_type": "PAY",
    "mode": "COMPONENTS",
    "capture_method": "MANUAL",
    "amount": 10000,
    "currency": "IDR",
    "country": "ID",
    "customer": {
        "reference_id": "{{$randomUUID}}",
        "type": "INDIVIDUAL",
        "email": "customer@yourdomain.com",
        "mobile_number": "+628123456789",
        "individual_detail": {
            "given_names": "John",
            "surname": "Doe"
        }
    },
    "components_configuration": {
        "origins": ["https://example.com"]
    }
}
```

**Response -** `POST /sessions`

```json
{
    "payment_session_id": "ps-69649592c951f34f173f803a",
    "created": "2026-01-12T06:32:50.550Z",
    "updated": "2026-01-12T06:32:50.550Z",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "reference_id": "{{$YOUR_REFERENCE_ID}}",
    "currency": "IDR",
    "amount": 10000,
    "country": "ID",
    "expires_at": "2026-01-12T07:02:50.059Z",
    "session_type": "PAY",
    "capture_method": "MANUAL",
    "mode": "COMPONENTS",
    "locale": "en",
    "business_id": "62440e322008e87fb29c1fd0",
    "customer_id": "cust-138123c0-50de-49bb-b804-ead0e1e35914",
    "capture_method": "AUTOMATIC",
    "components_sdk_key": "session-907388bd5ccd790edb241bed00c80000-pl-MHYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEACIDYgAE8zNjokzwdcj/11UkV77757+zQCQAc/Hsez5Ue2+UVEVXCKmQlVhpKGBHY1G5TPWIVUs4JdK8xLA9OihdACCRv7Z66B/caBfhU6V+pTXjiZ/OBcCYUP/cm4mkn5qHZ6N8-UQiUzNWiQad32u5F+pHrumyTsAPwCbojrBaEj+kNpsstysk7G6B4i+r7pgTMye860bMB1KVsLbBSMLYRB9gsb7x/5RJV0Y04yQ+sHBzHOLq3ab9g3g+IQ6C2YElXdvWf",
    "components_configuration": {
        "origins": ["https://example.com"]
    }
}
```

You can refer to the [Xendit Components client-side documentation](https://docs.xendit.co/docs/components-overview#clientside-responsibilities) for client-app integration using the returned `components_sdk_key`.

Upon successful authorization, Xendit will send a `payment_session.completed` webhook. The webhook contains the `payment_id` with status `AUTHORIZED`. You should store the `payment_id,`mark the order as **authorized,** and capture the payment once the order or service is confirmed.

## How to capture an authorized payment

To capture an authorized payment, use the [Payment API v3 capture endpoint](https://docs.xendit.co/apidocs/capture-payment) with the `payment_id` obtained from the authorization step.

Request - `POST /payments/{payment_id}/capture`

```json
{   
   "capture_amount": 10000 
}
```

If successful, you will received the `payment.capture` webhook the payment status will change to `CAPTURED`.

Uncaptured authorizations are valid for **7 days**. If the payment is not captured within this period, the authorization will automatically expire and the funds will be released to the customer.

If you intend to cancel the authorization before capturing it, you can call the [Cancel Payment endpoint](https://docs.xendit.co/apidocs/cancel-payment) using the same `payment_id`. This will void the authorization and release the held funds.
